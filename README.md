# üì© How to Install

**NOTE: You WILL need a HACKED/MODDED (RGH or JTAG) Xbox 360 in order to play this mod. We hope this is clear.**

* **Install your vanilla copy of Dance Central 3** to your console's hard drive.
  * In case anything goes wrong, we recommend that you **rename `default.xex` to `default_vanilla.xex`**.

* **Disable updates** for Dance Central 3 in Aurora. *Dance Central 3 Deluxe* rolls `TU1` into its base installation.

* Download [**Dance Central 3 Deluxe**](https://nightly.link/hmxmilohax/dance-central-3-deluxe/workflows/build/main/DC3DX-Xbox.zip). 
  * **Copy the contents of it to where your copy of Dance Central 3 is installed** (we recommend using FTP to do so).
  * Select `Yes` to overwrite the files if it asks you to.

### ‚úÖ ***Dance Central 3 Deluxe is now installed!***

<br/>

***Sidenote:*** We also recommend **clearing your system cache** if this is your first time installing the mod.
* Navigate to `System Settings > Storage` and press `Y` to clear the system cache.*

# üî® Building (Advanced)

### Initializing the Repo

* Go to the **[Releases](https://github.com/hmxmilohax/dance-central-3-deluxe/releases)** of this repo and **download `_init_repo.py`**.
  * Make a new **empty** folder, **put `_init_repo.py` in the folder, and run it**. This will pull the repo down for you and make sure you're completely up to date. **This will take some time.**

### ***The folder should look like this once it's done:***
